# Predicting-tree-type-based-on-surrounding-characteristics

This is a statistics final project on predicting tree types based on surrounding area characteristics.

Dataset: The original data set from kaggle contained 580,182 observations. 10000 observations were randomly selected, of which 80% samples are used as training dataset and the remaining as testing dataset. The dataset can be found in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset  
Model: This is a multinomial classification problem to classify seven types of trees. Various models including KNN, logistic regression, Regularization methods, Tree-based methods and ensemble methods are evaluated. The result shows ensemble methods with 70% bagging and 30% Random Forest achieved 80% accuracy and 0.847 AUC.
